Job Description:
 
Concept Product Manager for IAT

A concept manager in IAT will take an early concept (in the form of a service, adjacent product or prototype) and drive/accelerate the concept to a successful product-market fit with a customer backed approach. To achieve this product-market fit, this person will strike strong working relationships with BU partners and other stakeholders – some of whom may be eventual customers of the concepts. This individual will help to craft a vision for the concepts, and then develop prioritized bite sized pieces of work that lead towards that vision. They will help to identify the success metrics (input and output) and lead the team towards measuring their progress in context of the success metrics. They will dive deep into a market to understand the opportunities and issues and come up with actionable insights that move the concepts forward. In addition, they will be comfortable in striking external partnerships wherever necessary to keep the concepts moving forward towards a product-market fit. They will be equally comfortable in guiding the internal team as they would be in talking with the CEO of a company we are looking to partner with. This individual will be a champion of lean development and embrace and evangelize the lean startup fundamentals. In doing so, they will know the best way to design experiments for every concept to maximize the output and momentum. In cases where the experiments and data suggest that the concept is not worth moving forward, they will not be afraid to voice their POV and back that up with facts. As an entrepreneur is expected to wear multiple hats, this person would also be expected to dive into various aspects of the concept development as needed (design, technical implementation, market analysis etc).  This individual would have a technical background and be able to attain credibility from the team by inquiring about the important details, not advocating their point of view. 

Finally, this person will become the trusted partner for the technology team such there would be a visible difference in the pace of adoption of our concepts if we don’t have this individual on a team. 

Requirements:
•	Spend time with end-users to understand their pain points, gather insights on how we can solve some of those big customer problems in a delightful way.
•	Must have the ability to do some data analysis
•	Must be intellectually curious and demonstrate an eagerness to learn about the latest and greatest new technologies
•	Must have a 'can do' attitude with an entrepreneurial mindset and be comfortable working in a fast paced, unstructured environment
•	Can be a strong influential leader of a cross-functional team and manage multiple stakeholders
•	Have a passion to seek a deep understanding of customer needs and turn that insight into a compelling vision
•	3-5 years of Product Management work experience in a top tech company, payments company or innovative technology startup (or equivalent experience)
•	Outstanding written and oral communication skills
•	Strong execution and ability to drive work to completion
•	Excellent organizational and teamwork skills
•	Bachelor's degree in science or engineering from a top institution preferred, MBA or PhD a plus

1. QBFSP app team 1 and 2 management – we have a combined scrum team managed by the current worker who will be going out on paternity leave. The contract PM would act as the product owner, coordinating pre pre planning (backlog grooming with PM, XD, PD), pre planning (some call this product planning),  daily scrums (back to back scrums 30 min) and participating in any retrospectives. The contract PM would also participate in the design reviews.

2. Payroll first – this is a big initiative to convert our QuickBooks Full Service Payroll product to a standalone version that can unlock to QuickBooks. The contract PM would get to work with one of the best designers in all of IN (Kylie Tuosto). The contract PM would support Kylie throughout the effort, resolving questions pertaining to timing, breaking the project into components, ensuring that we deliver on time per the schedule by coordinating the PD team to work on an appropriate scope that matches their capacity. On-time delivery is important!

3. FTU funnel measurement -  The new setup process we’ve constructed should improve on our first time use metrics. More customers should get through set up faster, more often and be happier as a result. Keeping track of this and identifying places where the customers are getting stuck, making suggestions on how to improve based on the data is something Cliff was driving and the contract PM would own this.

4. Contact us – This is a project that the current worker has been leading to include chat within the setup process for QuickBooks Full Service Payroll. It is mostly done, but it needs to be shepherded through to completion, measured for its ability to help us achieve our goal of five minutes spent by the employer. It also requires coordination with our PD and care teams for rollout.

5. Same-day payroll -  this one is a bit more technical and if someone is looking for a full-time position, this would be the project prove yourself on. The goal here is to provide a same-day set up and same day payroll option for new customers. Today, payroll cannot be run until several days later after the setup agent has reviewed the setup and ensured accuracy and balancing. Enabling an option on the first day is the goal. Cliff has completed a lot of this work and thinking. The contract PM would move the ball along in his absence.
